Refresh your Redux knowledge
Use Redux to access + save User data

Are custom hooks the best way to get data? Maybe it's better to use Thunks, that way theres less API reptition? But Thunks are only good for getting initial data right? Hmm, maybe a central store of user data would be good... but it doesn't persist or anything huh? So on refresh I'd need to refetch all teh data...sounds about right
